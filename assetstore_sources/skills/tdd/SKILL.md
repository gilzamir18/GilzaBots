# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle: consult them before and during the loop, not after.

When exploring the codebase, read `GLOSSARY.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect the ADRs in `docs/adr/` for the area you're touching. The project's test command is usually in `AGENTS.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json` or the CI workflow; run tests with `run_command`.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behaviour through public interfaces, not implementation details. The code can change entirely; the tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification: "user can check out with a valid cart" says exactly what capability exists, and it survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines (both in this skill's directory).

## Seams: where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behaviour without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything, so agreeing the seams up front is how testing effort lands on the critical paths and the complex logic instead of every edge case.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?" Give each proposed seam a one-line note on what it catches and what it misses.

When the shape of that interface is itself in question (how deep the module is, where the seam belongs, what the interface should expose), call `load_skill("codebase-design")` for the vocabulary, if that skill is active. It is the shared source of the module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage and locality terms: a reference to consult, not a session to run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled**: mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the database instead of using the interface). The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behaviour hasn't changed.
- **Tautological**: the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`assert add(a, b) == a + b`, a snapshot derived by hand the same way, a constant asserted equal to itself), so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values come from an independent source of truth: a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
- **Horizontal slicing**: writing all the tests first, then all the implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behaviour: they test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behaviour, go insensitive to real changes, and commit to a test structure before the implementation is understood. Work in **vertical slices** instead: one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first and run it: watch it fail for the reason you expect. Then write only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage (the `code-review` skill), not the red → green cycle.
